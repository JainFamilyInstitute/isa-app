Individual,"We’ve defined “College Graduate” as someone who attended college for four years. High School Graduate is someone who didn’t have a single year of college. <br><br> The income level indicates earnings over a person’s lifetime. To generate these incomes, we modeled ten thousand agents and the ten thousand agents’ income across lifetimes. Then we divide them into quartiles, over the lifetime, with 2,500 in each quartile."
Borrowing Amount,"The average student debt in the US (inflation-adjusted to 2010 USD) is $30k. Choose among three scenarios: a low borrowing amount of 5k (which could cover a semester at community college, or incidentals); the “average” borrowing amount of 30k; and a high borrowing amount of 70k."
Risk,"Risk aversion is an individual’s preference for tolerating uncertainty. Your income is uncertain across your lifetime, subject to volatility and variation, and your tolerance to that affects your welfare. On this scale, 1 indicates relatively more comfort with risk--start-up CEOs can gather here (for example). 4 indicates more risk-averse. The population average is actually 3.8. <a href='https://www.nber.org/papers/t0099' target=""_blank"">Standard Risk Aversion by Miles Kimball</a>"
