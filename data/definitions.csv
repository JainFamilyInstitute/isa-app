Individual,"We’ve defined “College Graduate” as someone who attended college for four years. High School Graduate is someone who didn’t have a single year of college. <br><br> The income level indicates earnings over a person’s lifetime. To generate these incomes, we modeled ten thousand agents and the ten thousand agents’ income across lifetimes. Then we divide them into quartiles, over the lifetime, with 2,500 in each quartile."
Borrowing Amount,"The average student debt in the US (inflation-adjusted to 2010 USD) is $30k. Choose among three scenarios: a low borrowing amount of 5k (which could cover a semester at community college, or incidentals); the “average” borrowing amount of 30k; and a high borrowing amount of 70k."
Risk,"Risk aversion is an individual’s preference for tolerating uncertainty. Your income is uncertain across your lifetime, subject to volatility and variation, and your tolerance to that affects your welfare. On this scale, 1 indicates relatively more comfort with risk--start-up CEOs can gather here (for example). 4 indicates more risk-averse. The population average is actually 3.8. <a href='https://www.nber.org/papers/t0099' target=""_blank"">Standard Risk Aversion by Miles Kimball</a>"
College Premium Given Up,"The college premium is the welfare benefit that you get from graduating college, as compared to a just graduating high school. If you borrow for college, you give up a part of that benefit. The college premium given up depends on the amount you borrowed, how you borrowed, and your tolerance to risk. The higher this number, the less you benefitted from college. <br><br>
As you interact with this dataset, you’ll see that, for very risk-averse students (4) who’ve taken out a large amount of loans (70k), they give up a huge amount of the benefits of college--up to 40%, in our dataset.  But with an ISA, even if you need a large amount of financing, you don’t give up so much of the college premium. This is because ISAs present less risk to the student, since they’re making payments proportionate to their income rather than making high fixed payments, so even someone quite prone to worrying about making payments can make the most of life."
Jamie,"Jamie is a typical American college graduate. An English major, she wanted to work in publishing after graduation. She took out 30k in financing, had the “average” risk aversion of 3, and ended up with low-to-median level of lifetime earnings (in the 25-50% quartile). 

Try switching between ISA, Loan, and IDR and see what happened to her college premium given up. For the loan, the payments were high and fixed, but for the ISA and IDR, they were proportional to the income that Jamie made.  For Jamie, both an ISA and IDR allowed her to make lower payments in the early, low-earning years of her career, and so she was able to focus on her publishing job with less stress, consume more, accumulate more wealth, and live more happily across her life."
Rob,"Rob is a student under financial strain. The first in his family to go to college, he had to take out 70k in financing to afford tuition, housing, and incidentals, like textbooks and gas. He’s slightly more risk averse than average, at a 4, because he had to support his family as well. He ended up in the lowest income quartile. Notice that Rob’s college premium given up varies more dramatically than Jamie’s. Rob had to pause his career to take care of his mother for a few years, a period during which he only worked part-time. If he’d financed his education with a loan, this would be devastating, and it would be hard for Rob ever to get back on track. ISA or IDR financing, however, didn’t require him to pay during that period."
